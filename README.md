## Rust Programming Essentials : Rust Programming Essentials
In this module, you will learn how to get started with Rust, including how to declare variables and use simple types, how to implement flow control, how to use and define enums and how to use compound types and collections. By the end of this module, you will have a good grasp of the basics of the Rust programming language.

Learning Objectives
- Master the basics of Rust, including variable declaration, primitive data types, and type inference.
- Implement effective flow control using if-tests, matching, loops, and more.
- Define and utilize enums to manage restricted data sets and handle potential errors.
- Organize data efficiently with arrays, tuples, vectors, and maps, leveraging Rust's powerful collection types.
