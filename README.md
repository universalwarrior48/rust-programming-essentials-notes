## [Rust Programming Essentials : Rust Programming Essentials](Unit1/Syllabus.md)
In this module, you will learn how to get started with Rust, including how to declare variables and use simple types, how to implement flow control, how to use and define enums and how to use compound types and collections. By the end of this module, you will have a good grasp of the basics of the Rust programming language.

Learning Objectives
- Master the basics of Rust, including variable declaration, primitive data types, and type inference.
- Implement effective flow control using if-tests, matching, loops, and more.
- Define and utilize enums to manage restricted data sets and handle potential errors.
- Organize data efficiently with arrays, tuples, vectors, and maps, leveraging Rust's powerful collection types.

## [Rust Programming Essentials : Rust Ownership and Borrowing](Unit2/Syllabus.md)
In this module, you will learn about ownership and borrowing, areas where Rust differs from most other languages. The Rust compiler is very strict about what happens when you assign one variable to another. It defines rules about how data is copied or moved between objects and how you can reference these objects safely in your code without having to use low-level pointers. The motivation is to avoid some of the pitfalls and errors that are common in C and C++. This is incredibly important, and this module covers the rules carefully and systematically.

Learning Objectives
- Understand the strict rules defined by the Rust compiler regarding variable assignment and data movement between objects.
- Learn how to reference objects safely in Rust code without using low-level pointers.
- Explore the motivations behind Rust's ownership and borrowing system to avoid common pitfalls and errors found in languages like C and C++.
- Discuss the rules of Rust ownership and borrowing carefully and systematically to ensure a comprehensive understanding.
